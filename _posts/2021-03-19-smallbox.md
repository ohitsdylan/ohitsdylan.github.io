Once, I needed a lightbox to display images from a gallery in, but didn't want to use a heavy jQuery plugin, so I wrote my own. It turned out really well. It doesn't feature any previous or next buttons or zoom options.

It works by taking a scaled down image and presenting it at a larger (original) size.  
Clicking on the small image makes it big; clicking on the big image makes it small.

Set it up by creating a container element to display the image in.
We hide it by default and set the image source to an empty value so we can fill it in later.

```
<div class="lightbox" style="display: none;">
	<img class="lightbox-image" src="">
</div>
```

The jQuery to set the image attribute and show/hide the lightbox is rather small. If you wanted, it would be easy enough to replace the jQuery with vanilla javascript.

```
$('.gallery_item-image').click(function() {

    //Obtain the path of the image we clicked on
	var imgSource = $(this).attr('src');

    //Assign the image path to the lightbox
	$('.lightbox-image').attr('src', imgSource);

    //Activate
	$('.lightbox').fadeIn();
});

$('.lightbox').click(function() {

    //BYE
	$('.lightbox').fadeOut();
});
```

Finally, we style the lightbox with some CSS. Using CSS Grid we can place our lightbox image in the middle of the page. The positioning and size lets the lightbox float on top of everything.

We shade the rest of the content below with the transparent background image, change the cursor type to indicate an action, and adjust the z-index to keep it above the other content on the page.

Using the CSS property `object-fit` and its value `scale-down` we can keep our image's proportions accurate and still account for wide or tall images, instead of just square ones.

Props to [Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/) for her ["Modern CSS Centering" snip](https://smolcss.dev/#smol-grid-centering) and bits about the [`object-fit`](https://egghead.io/lessons/css-apply-aspect-ratio-sizing-to-images-with-css-object-fit) property.

```
.lightbox {
	display: grid;
	place-content: center;

	position: fixed;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;

	background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
	cursor: pointer;
	z-index: 2;
}

.lightbox-image {
	width: 100%;
	height: 75vh;
	padding: 0;
	object-fit: scale-down;
}
```

Simple!
