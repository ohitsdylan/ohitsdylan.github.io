Making and building things has always been an enjoyable process. Web development, tiny software projects, tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, it is all a good time. Even more so when you get to share the experience with other people.

And so making/building open source projects is a liberating thing. It is also a little scary, to just give something away for free, in a sense; to take all your hard work and just hand it out. It wears off quick, though, promise!

To provide a place to give something back or provide something useful for someone else is what I hope to do here, as others have done for me.

So, hello everyone. I hope you enjoy some neat things that are to come here.
