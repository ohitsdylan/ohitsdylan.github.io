        <h2>hello everyone</h2>
<p>14 Mar 2021 - dylan</p>

<p>Making and building things has always been an enjoyable process. Web development, tiny software projects, tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, it is all a good time. Even more so when you get to share the experience with other people.</p>

<p>And so making/building open source projects is a liberating thing. It is also a little scary, to just give something away for free, in a sense; to take all your hard work and just hand it out. It wears off quick, though, promise!</p>

<p>To provide a place to give something back or provide something useful for someone else is what I hope to do here, as others have done for me.</p>

<p>So, hello everyone. I hope you enjoy some neat things that are to come here.</p>
