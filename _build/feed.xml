Web development, tiny software projects, tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, it is all a good time. Even more so when you get to share the experience with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so making/building open source projects is a liberating thing. It is also a little scary, to just give something away for free, in a sense; to take all your hard work and just hand it out. It wears off quick, though, promise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide a place to give something back or provide something useful for someone else is what I hope to do here, as others have done for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, hello everyone. I hope you enjoy some neat things that are to come here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>dylan</name></author><summary type="html">Making and building things has always been an enjoyable process.
